# Batch Processing

Under the batch processing model, a set of data is collected over time, then fed into an analytics system. In other words, you collect a batch of information, then send it in for processing.

An example of batch processing is the way that credit card companies process billing. The customer does not receive a bill for each separate credit card purchase but one monthly bill for all of that month's purchases.

On the other hand, [[streaming-processing]] process as it is produced or received.
