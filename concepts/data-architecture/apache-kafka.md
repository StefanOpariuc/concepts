# Apache Kafka

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a [[distributed]] [[streaming-processing]] platform. What exactly does that mean?
A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

- [[publish-subscribe]] to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
- Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
- Process streams of records as they occur.

Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

- Building real-time streaming [[data-pipeline]] that reliably get data between systems or applications
- Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data
