# Data Pipeline

Data Pipeline is a broader term that encompasses [[etl]] as a subset. It refers to a system for moving data from one system to another. The data may or may not be transformed, and it may be processed in real time (or [[streaming-processing]]) instead of batches ([[batch-processing]]).

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[etl]: etl "Extract, transform, load"
[streaming-processing]: streaming-processing "Streaming Processing"
[batch-processing]: batch-processing "Batch Processing"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
