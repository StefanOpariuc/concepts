# Velocity (Software Development)

Velocity is a metric for work done, which is often used in agile software development. Measuring velocity is sometimes called velocity tracking. The velocity metric is used for planning sprints and measuring team performance.

> Velocity measures completed stories per iteration. The unit is work per time, e.g. 4 stories per 2 week iteration.

> [[cycle-time]] measures the amount of time passed working on a story. The unit is time per work, e.g. 2.5 days per story.
