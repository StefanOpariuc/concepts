# Integration Testing

[Integration Testing](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/integration-testing) is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Test drivers and test stubs are used to assist in Integration Testing.

To test how the user will interact with the application, use [[functional-testing]].
