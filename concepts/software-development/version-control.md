# Version Control

In computer software engineering, [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) or revision control is any kind of practice that tracks and provides control over changes to source code. Software developers sometimes use revision control software to maintain documentation and configuration files as well as source code.

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) (/ɡɪt/) is a [[distributed]] version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
