# Kubernetes (k8s)

[k8s](https://kubernetes.io/) is the orchestration layer for automating your deployment on any cloud infrastructure. You deploy a [[cluster]] of pods and k8s will manage how to bring them up and down automatically.

Kubernetes's [[declarative-programming]] approach to configuration, combined with [[git-ops]] enables you manage [[infrastructure-as-code]] to achieve greater speed, consistency and repeatability. [[reconciliation-loops]] also grant k8s self healing abilities.
