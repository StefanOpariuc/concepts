# Helm

The package manager ([[dependency-management]]) for [[kubernetes]]

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application. Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish — so start using Helm and stop the copy-and-paste.
