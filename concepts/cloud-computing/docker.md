[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a set of platform as a service products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, [[library]] and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

[[abstraction]] layer on how your application should run. Combined with [[kubernetes]], it makes it possible to deploy any code on any infrastructure easily.
