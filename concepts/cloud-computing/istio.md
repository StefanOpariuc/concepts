# Istio

[Istio.io](https://istio.io) serves as a control plane to configure a set of [[envoy-proxy]] proxies. Moves language-specific, low-level infrastructure concerns out of the applications into a [[service-mesh]]. e.g. retries, load balancing, timeouts, deadlines, circuit breaking, mutual TLS, service discovery, [[distributed]] tracing and others.

Since it has the ability to control the routing of traffic between services, it can handle routing around failures, different availability zones and control traffic flow.

Istio enables several higher-order [[cluster]] semantics, including:

- Service observability
- Graduated deployment and release
- Policy enforcement
- Cluster reliability
- Chaos testing
- Fleet configuration
- Strong security options

You can attach Istio to your [[kubernetes]] pods on deployment to gain all these benefits.
