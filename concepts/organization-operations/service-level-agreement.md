# Service Level Agreement

An SLA (service level agreement) is an agreement between provider and client about measurable metrics like uptime, responsiveness, and responsibilities. These metrics are fundamental to [[site-reliability-engineering]].

The SLA, SLO, and SLI are related concepts though they're different concepts.

SLA or Service Level Agreement is a contract that the service provider promises customers on service availability, performance, etc.
SLO or [[service-level-objective]] is a goal that service provider wants to reach.
SLI or [[service-level-indicator]] is a measurement the service provider uses for the goal.
